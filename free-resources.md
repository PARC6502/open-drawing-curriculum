| [ctrl+paint](https://www.ctrlpaint.com/library/) | This website is mainly a resource for teaching digital painting, however there is a good foundation on traditional drawing, going from the basics of how to hold a pencil and draw from the shoulder, all the way through anatomy, perspective and composition. |
| [drawabox](http://drawabox.com/)         | This website has a more technical approach to drawing, and builds towards dynamic sketching and constructive drawing. From the website: _"My goal is to teach students how to both convey the solidity and weight of the forms they draw, and to better understand how those forms relate to one another in 3D space as a part of more complex constructions."_ |
| [Proko](http://www.proko.com/library/)   | Proko has a massive library of free drawing videos. He covers the basics, figure drawing, anatomy and caricature. |
