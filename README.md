## What is this?

My goal is to create an open source, crowdsourced, curriculum for learning how to draw. I myself am still very early so I realise my early contributions will likely not be perfect, but my hope is that more experienced artists will contribute to this and it will result in a more useful resource. 

In the very near future, once I've set the foundations and structures for this resource, I plan to use a static site generator to deploy this in a more user friendly way. This will remain the source of the website, so contributions to this repository will be mirrored there.

## Motivation

I am currently learning to draw and am pretty serious about it. Whilst I've found a wealth of information, instruction and exercises online and in books I felt like I lacked a roadmap and structure on how to use these resources. 

What should I do first? How much time should I spend on doing drawabox exercises versus actually drawing? When I'm still at the beginning of my drawing journey how do I apply what I learn from the drawing exercises to my own journey? How do I go about drawing things from my imagination?

I hope to create resource that collects all this information, and more, in a single place. I want this to be the definitive free resource on how to go about learning to draw, from just starting off, and how to continue to improve.
