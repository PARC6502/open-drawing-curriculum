# Drawing Exercises

### Superimposing lines

Draw a straight line using a straight edge. After that draw over that line eight times. Do the same with curves.

**Exercise notes:** 

* Make sure you draw from the shoulder
* Try to superimpose as accurately as possible
* If you go too slow the line will wobble, if you go too quick you'll be way off target, find the right pace

### Ghosting lines and curves

**Lines:** Draw two points on the paper. Move your pen over the paper between the points without making a mark, training your arm for the motion. Once you feel confident about the motion put the mark down. 

**Curves:** Make a series of points on the paper. Move your pen over the paper in the motion of a curve that goes through all the points. Once you feel confident put down a curve that goes through all the points

### Upside down drawing

Find a drawing and turn it upside down. Spend 40 minutes to an hour copying the drawing. Do not turn the picture or your drawing the right way up until you are done.
