# Drawing Exercises

### Drawing from the shoulder

I am by no means an expert drawing, in fact I am barely even a beginner. However I have still come across this over and over again. It is mentioned in the Proko tutorials, it is heavily emphasised in drawabox, it is one of the first things taught in ctrl+paint's foundation videos. Draw from the shoulder, not the wrist.

Practice this by filling a page with lines, ellipses, and curves drawn from the shoulder. Focus on locking the wrist as you do this. Do not worry about line accuracy for this exercise, focus instead on fluidity. 

As you do other exercises keep this in mind.

### Superimposing lines

Draw a straight line using a straight edge. After that draw over that line eight times. Do the same with curves.

**Exercise notes:** 

* Make sure you draw from the shoulder
* Try to superimpose as accurately as possible
* If you go too slow the line will wobble, if you go too quick you'll be way off target, find the right pace

### Ghosting lines and curves

**Lines:** Draw two points on the paper. Move your pen over the paper between the points without making a mark, training your arm for the motion. Once you feel confident about the motion put the mark down. 

**Curves:** Make a series of points on the paper. Move your pen over the paper in the motion of a curve that goes through all the points. Once you feel confident put down a curve that goes through all the points

### Upside down drawing

Find a drawing and turn it upside down. Spend 40 minutes to an hour copying the drawing. Do not turn the picture or your drawing the right way up until you are done.
